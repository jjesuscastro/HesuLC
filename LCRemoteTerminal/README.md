# Lethal Company: Remote Terminal

## Summary

Open/close doors and disable turrets through chat and **new UI**.

Doing a solo run in Lethal Company is nearly impossible if you are spawned in a moon with numerous doors and turrets.

This mod lets you run terminal commands wherever you are through in-game chat.

Does not include Buy and Bestiary commands.
